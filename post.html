        content: '&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting too old for this nonsense&rdquo;, that was the moment I knew I witnessed a masterpiece. This Labor Day, I finally finished GTA V, and I picked the Deathwish ending. The game had given me the choice of killing Trevor or killing Michael, but I couldn&rsquo;t betray either of them, no matter how imperfect they were. Deathwish felt like the right ending because it matched the chaotic and friendship-driven way of the game.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Franklin was my favorite character to play as. He felt like the perfect balance of the other two, smart and wealth-hungry like Michael, and he had a lot of Trevor&rsquo;s loyalty towards his friends. He was good at planning during heists and helped his friends even when it wasn&rsquo;t his battle. That combination made him the character I wanted to be, the perfect balance of personalities.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hardest part for me was escaping Merryweather to escape with gold from &lsquo;The Big Score&rsquo;. It made sense to send a private militia to protect 4 tons of gold. Waves and waves of their mercenaries kept coming, and it felt endless, but I pushed through...'

        content: '&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daydream SV was the first hackathon I ever organized, and I thought it was gonna be scary, but it wasn&rsquo;t. It was actually fun. After Undercity ended at GitHub HQ, they told everyone during the closing ceremony that you could apply to run your own Daydream in your city. So I did. I applied for Silicon Valley, and somehow, I got it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We started planning in early August. We were emailing sponsors for money while the tech team built the website all month long. Then September was all about food, prizes, and activities. Finally in the last two weeks before the event, we were just marketing it in our community. We had 160 signups, but only 50 people showed up! And we planned food for 90. So we had six trays of Panda Express and eight boxes of Costco pizza left over. We gave five boxes of pizza to a group of kids walking outside the library. One of them was a 7th grader, just a year younger than me, and he folded the pizza and shoved it down his throat like it was a speedrun. He finished the whole box in just 30 seconds. We gave him two more boxes and two to his friend. He&rsquo;s probably gonna show up to every hackathon he can find for food now.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our venue was the community room at the Alum Rock branch of the San Jose Public Library. It was small, but we would make it work. Everyone who entered the main library building looked homeless because almost all of them had bags of clothes and shopping carts. My parents were actually scared to send me at first. There was even some blood spilled next to a payphone marked with hazard tape! At least we had a TV hooked up to a PC so we could play music the whole time. The mic was bad, but we were all so excited that our voices became the mic.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was bored at first. Everyone just started building their games right away, and I thought something would happen after the opening ceremony, but nope. So I played Minecraft Bedwars for a while. But one can only play so much Bedwars. That&rsquo;s when I remembered activities. Undercity had lightning talks, what should Daydream SV have? That&rsquo;s when it hit me: karaoke. I made a signup list and announced it. Everyone loved the idea. I sang &ldquo;Never Gonna Give You Up,&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Final Countdown,&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Danger Zone,&rdquo;, and I also jumped into other songs impromptu. During the whole time, we were on a video call with other Daydreams, and they got jealous, so they hosted karaoke too! The vibes and energy during the karaoke was in my mind, the highlight of the event.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some people were beginners, but the electricity in the air fueled people to learn new things. We hosted a Godot workshop, but people were too locked in on self-study and focused on their games. Everyone made a good game, like a game I&rsquo;d actually play in my free time. One guy made a pixelated Super Smash Bros. style game from scratch with really nice sprites and backgrounds. My favorite, though, was &ldquo;I (don&rsquo;t) like you.&rdquo; It was wild! You meet Mr. Nice Guy, an NPC whose kid&rsquo;s birthday is today, and then two seconds later, you come across a well blocking your path. You have to sacrifice Mr. Nice Guy by throwing him into the well to destroy it and to cross. I was not expecting that at all! It was such a good use of the theme &ldquo;Sacrifices must be made.&rdquo; The animation of throwing different NPCs down wells as you progress was perfect. No wonder they won first place.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our sponsor, Playdate, donated three Playdate consoles for first place. Each one is $200+ and has an amazing open-source game dev community. For second place, I used my past keyboard research and picked up the EA75. A creamy-sounding keyboard with RGB lights. For third place, we almost forgot, so I asked in the Discord what we should get. People said headphones. I found the Soundcore Q20 by Anker. With a 60-hour battery life and Active Noise Cancelling, it was an absolute steal.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was the youngest on the team. I was in finance and marketing. But, in addition to that, I planned all the food, picked the second and third place prizes, and was the only one who ordered a physical debit card from the Hack Club bank page. That card came in clutch when we had to print flyers for our sponsor using the library&rsquo;s ancient printer.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daydream SV is over now, but the memories will continue to live on. I organized an event that helped people build cool stuff. That&rsquo;s absolutely wild. Now I know it&rsquo;s not scary to run a hackathon. I&rsquo;ve got the tools and experience for all the future hackathons I&rsquo;m gonna run. I&rsquo;ve already started planning one at my school: Wolverine Hacks 2026. I&rsquo;ve set up the signup link, Discord, project submission link, and website at: <a href="https://wolverine-hacks.vercel.app/" style="color:#1155cc;text-decoration:underline;">https://wolverine-hacks.vercel.app/</a>. It is gonna be the first hackathon at my school and maybe the first hackathon in the Bay Area organized by only Middle Schoolers!

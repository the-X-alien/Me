        title: "Witnessing a Masterpiece of our Time",
        date: "September 10, 2025",

        content: "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting too old for this nonsense&rdquo;, that was the moment I knew I witnessed a masterpiece. This Labor Day, I finally finished GTA V, and I picked the Deathwish ending. The game had given me the choice of killing Trevor or killing Michael, but I couldn&rsquo;t betray either of them, no matter how imperfect they were. Deathwish felt like the right ending because it matched the chaotic and friendship-driven way of the game.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Franklin was my favorite character to play as. He felt like the perfect balance of the other two, smart and wealth-hungry like Michael, and he had a lot of Trevor&rsquo;s loyalty towards his friends. He was good at planning during heists and helped his friends even when it wasn&rsquo;t his battle. That combination made him the character I wanted to be, the perfect balance of personalities.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hardest part for me was escaping Merryweather to escape with gold from &lsquo;The Big Score&rsquo;. It made sense to send a private militia to protect 4 tons of gold. Waves and waves of their mercenaries kept coming, and it felt endless, but I pushed through. The hardest part was switching from one character to another to make sure none of them died because the mercenaries attacked all of us at once, and we were scattered across the parking lot. The twenty million payout afterwards felt good, though.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once I finished the story and had about twenty million, I put aside five hundred and used the rest to buy a ton of Merryweather stock. I thought owning a big piece of the company that tried to kill us would be the perfect example of irony.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The story had all sorts of unexpected twists and turns. Finding out Michael had lied to Trevor about Brad being alive was shocking. I was actually relieved when Trevor didn&rsquo;t kill Michael and chose to forgive him. That tiny bit of mercy in the middle of the chaos showed that Trevor is a good person. There couldn&rsquo;t have been a better ending than pushing Devin Weston off the cliff and taking out all my characters&rsquo; other enemies, all in one night. The sunrise set the mood perfectly, along with the song, &ldquo;The Set Up&rdquo;.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The PlayStation App says I spent fifty-eight hours on GTA! I played an hour or two every evening all summer, and on Labor Day, I decided to finish it and played for 3.5 hours. Throughout, I focused on the main missions and saved side quests for later, but I kept getting sidetracked while exploring the open world. I got lost in flying planes and zooming down the highway at two hundred miles per hour.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Early on, I hated the default car that each character spawns with because it was slow and looked bad, so each time I found a faster car. Near the end, when I needed cars for The Big Score and had to upgrade the ones I found, I realized I could also customize the default cars. I decked them out with side lights, a bright orange paint job, a carbon fiber spoiler and hood, maxed braking and speed upgrades, bulletproof tires, and limo-style windows. It handled better than most supercars I found, and if I crashed it, it would respawn fixed. Being able to see it on the map made it easy to find, and I used it much more often now.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the credits, I had the thought of working for Rockstar Games, the creator of GTA, and helping make GTA 7. So I went straight to Rockstar&rsquo;s jobs page and found that most positions are in-person. The closest office is in Los Angeles, and I am only willing to relocate as far as San Francisco, so unfortunately, I will not be able to help with the next masterpiece. Still, I am extremely excited for GTA 6. GTA V is 11 years old and still looks realistic. With the rumored budget and a map with multiple cities, I expect the next game to feel even more life-like.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No matter how annoying or hard a mission was, I never skipped cutscenes. I bought this game to play it, not just to finish it, and skipping the missions and cutscenes would have felt like not experiencing the whole game, which is why I bought it. The hard, tedious parts still make the game what it is.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few practical things I learned along the way might save you time. Always save before big missions because things go sideways. During Lester&rsquo;s assassination missions, invest in the competitors of the companies Lester tells you to sabotage. The stock will surge once you complete the mission, and you can sell for an insanely high return. Another tip is to buy Downtown Cab Co. because it is the fastest way to get across the map, and it lets you skip long car rides, which is also handy when you respawn at the hospital or when you want to travel across the map. Also, upgrade your main car early with speed, brakes, bulletproof tires, and carbon parts for speed and performance. A modded findable car is way better than the stock supercars that are slower and handle worse.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GTA V was a wild, chaotic story of a friendship that made my summer epic. From Franklin&rsquo;s loyalty to Trevor&rsquo;s unpredictability and Michael&rsquo;s ruthlessness and dedication to his family, the game made me laugh, gasp, and made the characters grow on me. If I replay it, Downtown Cab Co. is gonna be my first major purchase, and my custom car will be fully decked out from day one. If I redo the missions, then I will choose a different route than I did the first time, because for each mission, Lester gives you a choice on how you want to do it. GTA 5 was absolute cinema if you look past the violence and profanity. Right now, I am impatient for GTA 6, and I am hopeful that Rockstar will deliver a bigger, better, richer, and even more realistic experience.<be> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"

        content: "<p id="docs-internal-guid-bf60399b-7fff-6348-9574-e2745e85607b" dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Daydream SV was the first hackathon I ever organized, and I thought it was gonna be scary, but it wasn&rsquo;t. It was actually fun. After Undercity ended at GitHub HQ, they told everyone during the closing ceremony that you could apply to run your own Daydream in your city. So I did. I applied for Silicon Valley, and somehow, I got it.</span></p> <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">We started planning in early August. We were emailing sponsors for money while the tech team built the website all month long. Then September was all about food, prizes, and activities. Finally in the last two weeks before the event, we were just marketing it in our community. We had 160 signups, but only 50 people showed up! And we planned food for 90. So we had six trays of Panda Express and eight boxes of Costco pizza left over. We gave five boxes of pizza to a group of kids walking outside the library. One of them was a 7th grader, just a year younger than me, and he folded the pizza and shoved it down his throat like it was a speedrun. He finished the whole box in just 30 seconds. We gave him two more boxes and two to his friend. He&rsquo;s probably gonna show up to every hackathon he can find for food now.</span></p> <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At the end, we still had food left, so we gave some to a homeless couple sleeping outside the library. They ate one box of Panda Express sparingly and put the rest on their shopping cart. The next morning, when I came back for Day 2, I saw the same kids from the day before sitting outside waiting for the library to open. Their parents had dropped them off three hours before the library opened. One of the kids had red and purple marks on his arms and legs. I asked if he got hurt. His friend, the pizza inhaler, started to say something about his parents, but the kid aggressively cut him off. I&rsquo;m actually concerned for him.</span></p> <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Our venue was the community room at the Alum Rock branch of the San Jose Public Library. It was small, but we would make it work. Everyone who entered the main library building looked homeless because almost all of them had bags of clothes and shopping carts. My parents were actually scared to send me at first. There was even some blood spilled next to a payphone marked with hazard tape! At least we had a TV hooked up to a PC so we could play music the whole time. The mic was bad, but we were all so excited that our voices became the mic.</span></p> <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I was bored at first. Everyone just started building their games right away, and I thought something would happen after the opening ceremony, but nope. So I played Minecraft Bedwars for a while. But one can only play so much Bedwars. That&rsquo;s when I remembered activities. Undercity had lightning talks, what should Daydream SV have? That&rsquo;s when it hit me: karaoke. I made a signup list and announced it. Everyone loved the idea.&nbsp; I sang &ldquo;Never Gonna Give You Up,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Final Countdown,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Danger Zone,&rdquo; and I also jumped into other songs impromptu. During the whole time, we were on a video call with other Daydreams, and they got jealous, so they hosted karaoke too! The vibes and energy during the karaoke was in my mind, the highlight of the event.</span></p> <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Some people were beginners, but the electricity in the air fueled people to learn new things. We hosted a Godot workshop, but people were too locked in on self-study and focused on their games. Everyone made a good game, like a game I&rsquo;d actually play in my free time. One guy made a pixelated Super Smash Bros. style game from scratch with really nice sprites and backgrounds.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">My favorite, though, was &ldquo;I (don&rsquo;t) like you.&rdquo; It was wild! You meet Mr. Nice Guy, an NPC whose kid&rsquo;s birthday is today, and then two seconds later, you come across a well blocking your path. You have to sacrifice Mr. Nice Guy by throwing him into the well to destroy it and to cross. I was not expecting that at all! It was such a good use of the theme &ldquo;Sacrifices must be made.&rdquo; The animation of throwing different NPCs down wells as you progress was perfect. No wonder they won first place.</span></p> <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Our sponsor, Playdate, donated three Playdate consoles for first place. Each one is $200+ and has an amazing open-source game dev community. For second place, I used my past keyboard research and picked up the EA75. A creamy-sounding keyboard with RGB lights. For third place, we almost forgot, so I asked in the Discord what we should get. People said headphones. I found the Soundcore Q20 by Anker. With a 60-hour battery life and Active Noise Cancelling, it was an absolute steal.</span></p> <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I was the youngest on the team. I was in finance and marketing. But, in addition to that,&nbsp; I planned all the food, picked the second and third place prizes, and was the only one who ordered a physical debit card from the Hack Club bank page. That card came in clutch when we had to print flyers for our sponsor using the library&rsquo;s ancient printer.</span></p> <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Daydream SV is over now, but the memories will continue to live on. I organized an event that helped people build cool stuff. That&rsquo;s absolutely wild. Now I know it&rsquo;s not scary to run a hackathon. I&rsquo;ve got the tools and experience for all the future hackathons I&rsquo;m gonna run. I&rsquo;ve already started planning one at my school: Wolverine Hacks 2026. I&rsquo;ve set up the signup link, Discord, project submission link, and website at: </span><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://wolverine-hacks.vercel.app/"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-skip: none; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">https://wolverine-hacks.vercel.app/</span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">. It is gonna be the first hackathon at my school and maybe the first hackathon in the Bay Area organized by only Middle Schoolers!</span></p> <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; text-indent: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">If you want to learn more about Daydream Silicon Valley, check out </span><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://daydream.hackclub.com/sv"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #1155cc; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-skip: none; text-decoration-skip-ink: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">https://daydream.hackclub.com/sv</span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Nunito,sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">.

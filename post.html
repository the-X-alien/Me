        content: "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting too old for this nonsense&rdquo;, that was the moment I knew I witnessed a masterpiece. This Labor Day, I finally finished GTA V, and I picked the Deathwish ending. The game had given me the choice of killing Trevor or killing Michael, but I couldn&rsquo;t betray either of them, no matter how imperfect they were. Deathwish felt like the right ending because it matched the chaotic and friendship-driven way of the game.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Franklin was my favorite character to play as. He felt like the perfect balance of the other two, smart and wealth-hungry like Michael, and he had a lot of Trevor&rsquo;s loyalty towards his friends. He was good at planning during heists and helped his friends even when it wasn&rsquo;t his battle. That combination made him the character I wanted to be, the perfect balance of personalities.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hardest part for me was escaping Merryweather to escape with gold from &lsquo;The Big Score&rsquo;. It made sense to send a private militia to protect 4 tons of gold. Waves and waves of their mercenaries kept coming, and it felt endless, but I pushed through. The hardest part was switching from one character to another to make sure none of them died because the mercenaries attacked all of us at once, and we were scattered across the parking lot. The twenty million payout afterwards felt good, though.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Once I finished the story and had about twenty million, I put aside five hundred and used the rest to buy a ton of Merryweather stock. I thought owning a big piece of the company that tried to kill us would be the perfect example of irony.<be> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The story had all sorts of unexpected twists and turns. Finding out Michael had lied to Trevor about Brad being alive was shocking. I was actually relieved when Trevor didn&rsquo;t kill Michael and chose to forgive him. That tiny bit of mercy in the middle of the chaos showed that Trevor is a good person. There couldn&rsquo;t have been a better ending than pushing Devin Weston off the cliff and taking out all my characters&rsquo; other enemies, all in one night. The sunrise set the mood perfectly, along with the song, &ldquo;The Set Up&rdquo;.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The PlayStation App says I spent fifty-eight hours on GTA! I played an hour or two every evening all summer, and on Labor Day, I decided to finish it and played for 3.5 hours. Throughout, I focused on the main missions and saved side quests for later, but I kept getting sidetracked while exploring the open world. I got lost in flying planes and zooming down the highway at two hundred miles per hour.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Early on, I hated the default car that each character spawns with because it was slow and looked bad, so each time I found a faster car. Near the end, when I needed cars for The Big Score and had to upgrade the ones I found, I realized I could also customize the default cars. I decked them out with side lights, a bright orange paint job, a carbon fiber spoiler and hood, maxed braking and speed upgrades, bulletproof tires, and limo-style windows. It handled better than most supercars I found, and if I crashed it, it would respawn fixed. Being able to see it on the map made it easy to find, and I used it much more often now.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the credits, I had the thought of working for Rockstar Games, the creator of GTA, and helping make GTA 7. So I went straight to Rockstar&rsquo;s jobs page and found that most positions are in-person. The closest office is in Los Angeles, and I am only willing to relocate as far as San Francisco, so unfortunately, I will not be able to help with the next masterpiece. Still, I am extremely excited for GTA 6. GTA V is 11 years old and still looks realistic. With the rumored budget and a map with multiple cities, I expect the next game to feel even more life-like.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No matter how annoying or hard a mission was, I never skipped cutscenes. I bought this game to play it, not just to finish it, and skipping the missions and cutscenes would have felt like not experiencing the whole game, which is why I bought it. The hard, tedious parts still make the game what it is.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few practical things I learned along the way might save you time. Always save before big missions because things go sideways. During Lester&rsquo;s assassination missions, invest in the competitors of the companies Lester tells you to sabotage. The stock will surge once you complete the mission, and you can sell for an insanely high return. Another tip is to buy Downtown Cab Co. because it is the fastest way to get across the map, and it lets you skip long car rides, which is also handy when you respawn at the hospital or when you want to travel across the map. Also, upgrade your main car early with speed, brakes, bulletproof tires, and carbon parts for speed and performance. A modded findable car is way better than the stock supercars that are slower and handle worse.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GTA V was a wild, chaotic story of a friendship that made my summer epic. From Franklin&rsquo;s loyalty to Trevor&rsquo;s unpredictability and Michael&rsquo;s ruthlessness and dedication to his family, the game made me laugh, gasp, and made the characters grow on me. If I replay it, Downtown Cab Co. is gonna be my first major purchase, and my custom car will be fully decked out from day one. If I redo the missions, then I will choose a different route than I did the first time, because for each mission, Lester gives you a choice on how you want to do it. GTA 5 was absolute cinema if you look past the violence and profanity. Right now, I am impatient for GTA 6, and I am hopeful that Rockstar will deliver a bigger, better, richer, and even more realistic experience.<be> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"
